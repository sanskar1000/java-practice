# Java Practice Repository

A structured Java practice repository focused on building strong programming fundamentals through
clear examples, logical problem-solving, and consistent practice.

This repository is designed to move step-by-step from basic syntax to core Java concepts in a clean and organized manner.

📌 Purpose of This Repository
	•	Strengthen Java fundamentals
	•	Practice concepts with small, focused programs
	•	Build a clean learning trail for revision and interviews
	•	Develop disciplined coding and repository structure

## Learning Approach

   - One concept at a time
	-	Simple and readable code
	-	Logic written for understanding, not memorization
	-	Practice-oriented structure
	-	Gradual increase in difficulty

## Upcoming Topics
- Arrays
- Strings
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling
- File Handling
- Mini Projects

🛠 Tools & Language
	•	Language: Java
	•	IDE: Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse)
	•	Java Version: Standard JDK

📌 Notes
	•	Each program focuses on one concept
	•	Folder naming follows topic-wise organization
	•	Code is intentionally kept simple for clarity

## Progress Philosophy
  Consistency beats intensity.
This repository is updated gradually as concepts are learned and practiced.

## Purpose

This repository tracks my progress in Java and helps me
develop logical thinking and clean coding habits.
