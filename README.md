# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java learning and practice programs.
I am using this repository to build strong fundamentals in Java
by practicing each concept with simple and clear examples.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is created to build strong Java fundamentals through
step-by-step practice. Each topic is practiced using:
- concept demos
- pattern programs
- logical practice problems

The focus is on understanding logic, not memorizing syntax.

## Topics Covered

### Java Basics
- Comments
- Data Types
- Variables
- Type Casting
- Literals
- Input and Output

### Operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Unary operators
- Ternary operator

### Conditional Statements
- if statement
- if-else statement
- else-if ladder
- nested if
- switch statement
- practice programs for decision making

### Loops
- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- Nested loops
- Pattern programs
- Logical practice problems

### Advanced Control Statements
- break statement
- continue statement
- labeled break
- nested if with loops

### Methods
- Method basics
- Parameters and arguments
- Return types
- Method overloading
- Practice program of methods
