# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java learning and practice programs.
I am using this repository to build strong fundamentals in Java
by practicing each concept with simple and clear examples.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is created to build strong Java fundamentals through
step-by-step practice. Each topic is practiced using:
- concept demos
- pattern programs
- logical practice problems

The focus is on understanding logic, not memorizing syntax.
